# Shreyas Gowda K — Portfolio

This is a professional, minimal, interactive portfolio scaffold built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It's designed to present your skills (Java, C, Python, MySQL), projects, and contact details in a clean corporate style. Replace placeholders and link to your GitHub and resume.

Quick start

1. Place your profile photo at `assets/profile.jpg`. Use a professional headshot (not a cartoon).
2. GitHub: https://github.com/shreyasgowdak27 (username: shreyasgowdak27)
2. Update links in `index.html` (GitHub URL, resume link, mailto address).
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.

Deploy

- For GitHub Pages: push this folder to a repository and enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings.

Notes

- The contact form currently uses a `mailto:` action — replace with a real endpoint if you want form submissions handled.
- Update skills and project cards with real percentages, descriptions, and GitHub links. The project "View on GitHub" links currently point to your profile: https://github.com/shreyasgowdak27
 - Update skills and project cards with real percentages, descriptions, and GitHub links. The SQL practice repository link has been set to: https://github.com/shreyasgowdak27/mySQL.git
